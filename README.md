## F.A.Q

Answer a few frequently asked questions;

### Can you read my messages?

This project is open source so all the codes are clear. Neither less nor more; you can look what you want. **We absolutely do not have access to your accounts.**

### What about our security?

If you are concerned about security, you can install it on your own computer. If you think someone else has captured your data, simply click on **Whatsapp> Three Dots> Whatsapp Web> Logout** from all sessions button.
